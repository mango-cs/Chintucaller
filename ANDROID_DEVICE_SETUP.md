# 📱 Test on Your Android Phone - Setup Guide

## Why Flutter is Better Than Expo Go

**Expo Go:** Runs your app inside a container app (limited features, slow)  
**Flutter:** Installs your REAL app directly on your phone (full features, native speed)

You get:
- ✅ Full native performance
- ✅ All device features (camera, mic, permissions)
- ✅ Hot reload works perfectly
- ✅ Test the actual app users will download

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode on Your Phone

1. **Open Settings** on your Android phone
2. **Go to "About Phone"** (might be under System)
3. **Find "Build Number"**
4. **Tap it 7 times** (you'll see "You are now a developer!")

### Step 2: Enable USB Debugging

1. **Go back to Settings**
2. **Find "Developer Options"** (usually under System or About)
3. **Toggle ON "Developer Options"**
4. **Toggle ON "USB Debugging"**
5. **(Optional but recommended)** Toggle ON "Install via USB"

### Step 3: Connect Your Phone

1. **Plug your phone into computer** using USB cable
2. **On your phone:** You'll see a popup "Allow USB Debugging?"
3. **Check "Always allow from this computer"**
4. **Tap "Allow"**

### Step 4: Verify Connection

**Double-click `check_devices.bat`** (I'll create this for you)

Or run:
```powershell
C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat devices
```

You should see your phone listed!

### Step 5: Run Your App!

**Option A: Double-click `run_android.bat`**

**Option B: Press `F5` in VSCode** → Select "Physical Android"

**Option C: Command line:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\conta\OneDrive\Desktop\custom-software\Chintucaller
C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat run --dart-define-from-file=env.json -d android
```

The app will:
1. Build (takes 1-3 minutes first time)
2. Install on your phone
3. Launch automatically
4. **Hot reload enabled!** - Save files to see changes instantly

## 🔥 Development Workflow

Once running:

**Make code changes** → **Save file** → **Changes appear on phone instantly!** (Hot reload)

**In terminal:**
- Press `r` - Hot reload
- Press `R` - Hot restart
- Press `q` - Quit
- Press `h` - Help

**No need to rebuild or reinstall!** Changes appear in seconds.

## 🎯 Testing Real Features

Your app uses:
- **Microphone** - Works perfectly on real device
- **Audio recording** - Test real quality
- **Permissions** - See actual Android permission dialogs
- **Supabase** - Real network requests
- **Camera** (if used) - Real camera access

All features work exactly as they will for end users!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No devices found"

**Check USB cable:**
- Try a different cable (some are charge-only)
- Make sure it's plugged in properly

**Check USB mode:**
- Swipe down on phone notifications
- Tap USB notification
- Select "File Transfer" or "MTP" mode

**Check USB debugging:**
- Settings → Developer Options
- Make sure "USB Debugging" is ON

**Try:**
```powershell
# Check if ADB sees your device
C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat doctor -v
```

### "Unauthorized device"

On your phone, you should see "Allow USB debugging?" popup.
- Tap "Always allow"
- Tap "Allow"

If you don't see it:
- Revoke USB debugging authorizations in Developer Options
- Unplug and replug USB cable
- Popup should appear

### "Offline device"

- Unplug and replug USB cable
- Try a different USB port
- Restart phone
- Restart computer

### Wireless Debugging (Android 11+)

If you prefer no cable:

1. Connect phone to **same WiFi** as computer
2. On phone: Developer Options → Wireless Debugging → ON
3. Tap "Pair device with pairing code"
4. On computer:
```powershell
C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat devices
# Note your device IP
```
5. Follow pairing instructions
6. Now you can develop wirelessly!

## 📊 Performance Testing on Real Device

**Profile Mode** (test performance):
```powershell
C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat run --profile --dart-define-from-file=env.json -d android
```

**Release Mode** (final testing):
```powershell
C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat run --release --dart-define-from-file=env.json -d android
```

Or just double-click `test_performance.bat`

## 🎯 Your Development Flow

**Daily:**
1. Plug in phone (or connect wirelessly)
2. Press `F5` in VSCode
3. Develop with instant hot reload
4. Test audio, camera, permissions on real hardware

**No emulator needed!** Your phone is faster and more accurate anyway.
