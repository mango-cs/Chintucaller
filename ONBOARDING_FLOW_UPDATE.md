- Explains why we need it
- Requests notification permission
- Then navigates to OTP screen

### ‚úÖ 2. OTP Verification ‚Üí Default Dialer Permission
**DONE:** After entering OTP and verifying:

###  4. Voice Selection Page (NEXT)

- Navigate to Permissions page

### ‚è≥ 5. Permissions Page (NEXT)
**TODO:** Update to properly handle:
- "Grant All Permissions" button
- Request each permission one by one
- Or show dialog to open Settings if denied
- Handle denied permissions gracefully
- Navigate to Home Dashboard when done

## Current Flow (What's Working Now)

   ‚Üì [Grant all]
   
6. Home Dashboard
```

## Permissions Added to AndroidManifest.xml

## New Files Created

   - Comprehensive permission handling
   - Request individual permissions
   - Request all permissions at once
   - Check permission status

## What to Test Now

**On Your Phone:**
1. Open app ‚Üí Phone Login screen
2. Enter phone number ‚Üí Click "Send OTP"
3. **EXPECT:** Dialog asking for notification permission
4. Allow/Deny ‚Üí Goes to OTP screen
5. Enter OTP (any 6 digits for testing) ‚Üí Click "Verify OTP"
6. **EXPECT:** Dialog asking to set as default phone app
7. Continue ‚Üí System shows default dialer dialog
8. **EXPECT:** Navigate to Name Input page
9. Enter name ‚Üí **SELECT GENDER** (Male/Female/Other)
10. Click Proceed ‚Üí Should go to Voice Selection

## What Still Needs Work

### Voice Selection Page
- Remove unnecessary options
- Keep only Male/Female
- Add preview functionality
- Play sample audio: "Hi {username}, this is your AI assistant"

### Permissions Page
- Better "Grant All" implementation
- Request permissions sequentially
- Show which ones are granted/denied
- Handle "Settings" navigation if denied
- Beautiful UI for permission status

## Known Issues

- Voice selection doesn't filter by gender yet
- Permissions page doesn't request permissions properly yet
- Some permissions might fail on first try (normal Android behavior)

## Next Steps

1. **Test current flow** on your phone
2. **Report issues** you find
3. I'll update Voice Selection page
4. I'll update Permissions page
5. Complete the flow!
