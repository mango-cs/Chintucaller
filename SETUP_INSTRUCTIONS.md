$env:Path += ";C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin"
```

### "Android licenses not accepted"?
```powershell
C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat doctor --android-licenses
```
Press `y` for all.

### Emulator won't start?
- Enable virtualization in BIOS (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
- Restart computer after enabling
- Or use a physical Android device instead

### Physical Android Phone Setup
1. Enable Developer Options:
   - Settings ‚Üí About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
2. Enable USB Debugging:
   - Settings ‚Üí Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"
3. Connect via USB
4. On phone, tap "Allow" when prompted
5. Run: `C:\Users\conta\flutter\bin\flutter.bat devices`

## üì± iOS Development (You're on Windows)

Since you're on Windows, you **cannot** develop for iOS locally. Options:

### Option 1: Physical iPhone Only
- Connect iPhone via USB
- Test directly on device
- Limited (no simulator access)

### Option 2: Cloud CI/CD (Recommended)
Use **Codemagic** for iOS builds:
1. Sign up: https://codemagic.io/start (free tier)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Configure iOS build
4. Get IPA file for TestFlight/App Store

### Option 3: Get a Mac
- Mac Mini M1/M2 (~$500 used)
- Remote access from Windows
- Full iOS development capability

**For production-grade iOS app:** You'll need Option 2 or 3.
