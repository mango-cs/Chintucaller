## 🎮 Hot Reload (Your Best Friend)

Once your app is running, you can make changes and see them instantly:

- **Press `R`** in terminal = Hot restart (fresh start)
- **Press `q`** = Quit app

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Device not found"?
```powershell
flutter devices
```
If your phone isn't listed:
- Check USB cable is connected
- Check USB Debugging is enabled on phone
- Try a different USB port
- Try "File Transfer" mode on phone (not just charging)

### "Flutter command not found"?
- Restart PowerShell/VS Code
- Check Flutter is in PATH: `$env:Path`
- Re-run `install_flutter.ps1`

### Build errors?
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.json
```

## 🏆 Why Physical Phone > Emulator?

**Physical Phone:**
- ✅ Faster (no emulator boot time)
- ✅ Real hardware (actual performance)
- ✅ Real audio/camera (critical for your app!)
- ✅ True user experience

**Emulator:**
- ❌ Slow boot time (30-60 seconds)
- ❌ Simulated hardware
- ❌ Poor audio/camera simulation
- ✅ Good for testing different screen sizes

**Bottom Line:** Use your physical phone for 90% of testing. Much faster and better!

---

## 🎯 Daily Workflow

1. **Morning:** Connect phone via USB (leave it connected)
2. **Code:** Make changes in VS Code
3. **Test:** Press `r` for hot reload (see changes instantly!)
4. **Repeat:** Code → hot reload → code → hot reload
5. **Evening:** Disconnect phone

**That's it!** Super fast and efficient. 🚀
